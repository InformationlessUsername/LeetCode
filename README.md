# LeetCode Solutions in Python

This repository contains my Python solutions to LeetCode problems. Each solution is named according to the problem number and is stored in a separate `.py` file.

## Solution layout

Each solution will include the following:

- the problem number and name
- A link to the problem on LeetCode
- The problem description
- The logic behind the solution
- The code itself, with comments

## Note

- The final runtime and memory used are not included in the solution because they are too variable between different submissions of the same exact code.
- Certain imports may be added to the top of the file to make the code more readable (e.g. `from typing import *`)
