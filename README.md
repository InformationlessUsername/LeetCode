# LeetCode Solutions in Python

This repository contains my Python solutions to LeetCode problems. Each solution is named according to the problem number and is stored in a separate `.py` file.

## Solution layout

Each solution will include the following:

- the problem number and name
- A link to the problem on LeetCode
- The problem description
- The logic behind the solution
- The code itself, with comments
- The final runtime and memory used, along with the relative percentiles

## Note

- The final runtime and memory used are taken from LeetCode's own runtime and memory usage statistics. However, the code is cleaned up (comments removed, whitespace removed, etc.) before submission by the cleanup.py file to avoid artificially high runtimes and memory usage.
- Slight adaptations may be made to the template provided by LeetCode (e.g. `List[int]` becomes `list[int]`)
- Certain imports may be added to the top of the file to make the code more readable (e.g. `from typing import Optional`)
